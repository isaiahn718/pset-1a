		<p> Phase 1 of Kanye's discography begins with College Dropout, his first, and also breakthrough album that put the name "Kanye West" into the public's mind. The album released in early 2004 to critical aclaim. The album garnered major attention for its interesting production style. This was when Kanye began experimenting with soul beats, speeding up old r&b tracks and using them as the beat for his raps. On the album Kanye spoke about many things, mainly how Kanye struggled to become a rapper, how the Billboard was corrupt for allowing music that talked about guns and violence to be played on radio while talking about religion would not be played, and to respect the grind (to fame and fortune), regardless of what the grind is. This is also when Kanye began using his signature mascot, the Dropout Bear.

		<p> Following the College Dropout, Kanye released Late Registration in mid 2005. Late Registration demonstrated a major improvement in production, as it was far more elegant than its predecessor. Kanye delves into more political issues, and how they affect him as a person. These include drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade. The album debuted at number 1 on the top 100 Billboard, and garnered huge attention once again, hitting hard with singles such as "Gold Digger" and "Touch the Sky." Kanye won best rap album of the year in the Grammy's, and kicked off Kanye's win streak in terms of album quality.
